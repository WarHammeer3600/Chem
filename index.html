	<br />
	<br />
Answer the following questions and write out the answers without the units. You may round your answers.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
  
  1. The equation shows the reaction between magnesium and sulfuric acid.
	<br />
	<br />

			Mg + H2SO4 → MgSO4 + H2
	<br />
	<br />

(Mg = 24, H = 1, S = 32, O = 16)
	<br />
	<br />

In this reaction, what mass of magnesium sulfate will be formed when 6g of magnesium reacts with excess sulfuric acid?
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />

  2. Carbon monoxide burns in oxygen to produce carbon dioxide
	<br />
	<br />

	2CO(g) + O2(g) → 2CO2(g)
	<br />
	<br />
	
	
What mass of carbon dioxide is produced from 14 g of carbon monoxide?
	<br />
	<br />
<br />
  3. Ammonia is formed when 28g of nitrogen combine with 6g of hydrogen
What mass of nitrogen combines with 1.5 g of hydrogen?
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />

  4.A student mixed together 25.0 cm3 of 1.00 mol / dm3 hydrochloric acid and 25.0 g of calcium carbonate.
	<br />
	<br />2HCl(aq) + CaCO3(s) → CaCl 2(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)
	<br />
	<br />
	What is the maximum volume of carbon dioxide gas that could be collected at room temperature and pressure?
	<br />
	<br />
  	<br />
	You will find the next clue using the same format as the previous puzzle. (Be careful not to add in any decimal points)
